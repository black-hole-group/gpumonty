                        GRMONTY  version 1.0   (released February 1, 2013)

    This file is part of GRMONTY.  GRMONTY v1.0 is a program that calculates the
    emergent spectrum from a model using a Monte Carlo technique.

    This version of GRMONTY is configured to use input files from the HARM code
    available on the same site.   It assumes that the source is a plasma near a
    black hole described by Kerr-Schild coordinates that radiates via thermal 
    synchrotron and inverse compton scattering.
    
    You are morally obligated to cite the following paper in any
    scientific literature that results from use of any part of GRMONTY:

    Dolence, J.C., Gammie, C.F., Mo\'scibrodzka, M., \& Leung, P.-K. 2009,
        Astrophysical Journal Supplement, 184, 387

    GRMONTY directly from our distribution website:

   set up the metric (indicies both up and down), and the
   connection coefficients on a grid, based
   on a HARM simulation grid.  
   
   In principle the geometry could be sampled on a finer or
   coarser grid than the simulation grid. 

   These routines are taken directly out of HARM.

   They require the code be compiled against the 
   Gnu scientific library (GSL).
