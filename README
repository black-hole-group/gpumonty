GRMONTY is a relativistic Monte Carlo code.

GRMONTY is parallelized using openMP.

This version is configured to use input from harm2d, which is also available on this site.

quick start:

# unpack the tarball
tar -xzvf grmonty.tgz

# make (requires openmp enabled gcc)
make

# set number of threads (example is for csh and 8 threads)
setenv OMP_NUM_THREADS 8

# run the code on the supplied harm output file
# arguments are:
# -estimate of photon number (actual number is probabilistic due to scattering)
# -harm dump file for model
# -mass unit (few x 10^19 is appropriate for Sgr A*)
./grmonty 5000000 dump019 4.e19 >&! grmonty.err

# will output spectrum to grmonty.spec
# which should be identical to grmonty_spec_verify

Then use SM script plspec to plot up broad-band spectral energy distribution.

To calculate spectra from other sources, replace harm_model.c
with your own source model.  Begin by modifying harm_model.c.

You must supply

init_model 
make_super_photon
bias_func
get_fluid_params
report_spectrum
stop_criterion
record_criterion

gcon_func 
gcov_func 
get_connection

in the model file.
