GRMONTY  version 1.0   (released February 1, 2013)
=====================

This file is part of GRMONTY.  GRMONTY v1.0 is a program that calculates the emergent spectrum from a model using a Monte Carlo technique. This version of GRMONTY is configured to use input files from the HARM code available on the same site.   It assumes that the source is a plasma near a black hole described by Kerr-Schild coordinates that radiates via thermal synchrotron and inverse compton scattering.
